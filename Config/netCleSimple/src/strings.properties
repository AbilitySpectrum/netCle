LDS_ONE_BTN_MOUSE   = Control a mouse with a single button. A quick click generates a mouse left-click.<br/>\
    Press and hold the button to select cursor control.<br/>\
    Releasing after one beep puts the netCl\u00e9 into mouse-up mode. In this mode pressing the button will move the cursor up.<br/>\
    You may press and hold to move the cursor quickly, or use quick taps to nudge the cursor to the desired location.<br/>\
    Release the button after two beeps and netCl\u00e9 will enter mouse-down mode.<br/>\
    Three beeps gets you to mouse-left mode and four gives you mouse-right.<br/>\
    When in one of the cursor control modes stop touching the button for 2 seconds and a low beep will announce<br/>\
    that the system has reset and you may choose a new mouse direction.
LDS_TWO_BTN_MOUSE   = Control cursor motion with two toggle buttons.<br/>\
    One button controls up & down cursor motion the other controls left & right.<br/>\
    Press a button to move the cursor in one direction. Release the button until you hear a beep and then <br/>\
    press the button again to move the cursor in the opposite direction.<br/>\
    There is a half-second delay before the change of direction takes place.  This makes it possible to use<br/>\
    repeated quick taps to finely adjust the cursor position.                  
LDS_JOYSTICK_MOUSE1 = This is a simple control which uses a joystick to move the mouse up, down left and right.<br/>\
    You can optionally add the ability to generate a left- or right-mouse click by giving the joystick a quick left or right tap.
LDS_JOYSTICK_MOUSE2 = Allows a joystick and a button to control mouse motion and scrolling.<br/>\
    When the button is pressed once the joystick up- down-motion will control scrolling.<br/>\
    Pressing the button again returns the joystick to cursor control mode.<br/>\
    If you are using the light box it will indicate whether you are in mouse-moving or scrolling mode.<br/>\
    You can optionally add the ability to generate a left- or right-mouse click by giving the joystick a quick left or right tap.
LDS_GYRO_MOUSE      = Allows the use of head motions to control the cursor.<br/>\
    Attach the cursor to side of the head using a head band, the arm of a pair of glassed or a cap<br/>\
    with the wire hanging straight down.<br/>\
    Before using press the <i>Calibrate</i> button and follow the instructions.

    
Use a gyroscope attached to a head band or glasses to control a mouse with head motions.

# -- mouse buttons - one button
LDS_LEFT_CLICK       = The button generates a left-click when pressed.
LDS_RIGHT_CLICK      = The button generates a right-click when pressed.
LDS_LEFT_PRESS_RELEASE_TOGGLE = When the button is pressed a left-button press-and-hold action is generated.<br/>\
    Pressing the button again generates a left-button release.<br/>\
    Thus, you can tap the button, move the cursor and then tap the button again to perform a drag and drop operation.<br/>\
    This enables drag and drop for someone who has difficulty pressing and holding a button.
LDS_LEFT_EMULATION   = The button acts exactly like the left-mouse button.<br/>\
    It is pressed when pressed, remains pressed when held and is released when released.
LDS_THREE_FUNC_BUTTON  = This button provides the most useful mouse-click functions.<br/>\
    Tap it once to generate a left-click.<br/>\
    Press and hold the button, releasing after one beep to generate a right-click.<br/>\
    Release after two beeps to generate a left-mouse press-and-hold, initiating drag and drop.<br/>\
    Use a quick tap to release the held button.

# -- mouse buttons - two button
LDS_LEFT_RIGHT_CLICK     = One button generates a left-click, the other generates a right-click.

# -- mouse buttons - other
LDS_JOYSTICK_CLICKS = There is an option to generate left- and right-clicks using quick<br/>\
    left and right motions with the <i>Joystick Mouse.</i><br/>\
    To enable this select <i>Joystick Mouse 1</i> or <i>Joystick Mouse 2</i><br/>\
    under <i>Control Cursor Motion</i> and then select the<br/>\
    <i>Enable left & right mouse clicks</i> option.
LDS_GYRO_CLICKS     = There is an option to generate left- and right-clicks using quick<br/>\
    head motions with the <i>Gyro Mouse</i>.<br/>\
    To enable this select <i>Gyro Mouse</i> under <i>Control Cursor Motion</i><br/>\
    and then select the appropriate options.

# -- scrolling
LDS_SCROLL_UP_DOWN_TOGGLE  = One button toggles between scrolling up and scrolling down.<br/>\
    Press the button to move scroll down. Release the button until you hear a beep and then <br/>\
    press the button again to scroll up.<br/>\
    There is a half-second delay before the change of direction takes place.  This makes it possible to use<br/>\
    repeated quick taps to finely adjust the scroll position.                  
LDS_SCROLL_UP_DOWN  = One button scrolls up, the other scrolls down.
LDS_JOYSTICK_SCROLL = <i>Joystick Mouse 2</i> (under <i>Control Cursor Motion</i>)<br/>\
    allows the joystick to be used for both cursor control and scrolling.

# -- keyboard
LDS_KEYBOARD_TEXT     = Send up to 20 characters (optionally ending with RETURN)<br/>\
        by pressing a single button.
LDS_KEYBOARD_SPECIAL  = Send a special character (e.g. Page Up, Home or F3).
LDS_KEYBOARD_MODIFIER = Sometimes it can be difficult to press two keys at the same time.<br/>\
    This can make it impossible to type things like control+C.<br/>\
    This solution allows you to create a button that will send a modifier key (like shift or control)<br/>\
    and a regular key with a single press.
LDS_UP_DOWN_ARROW_TOGGLE    = One button which generates up- and down- arrow keystrokes.<br/>\
    Press the button to send a down-arrow. Release the button until you hear a beep and then <br/>\
    press the button again to send an up-arrow.<br/>\
    There is a half-second delay before the change of direction takes place, allowing the use of<br/>\
    repeated quick taps to make fine adjustments.  
LDS_KEYBOARD_SHIFT    = One button which generates a shift-key press event when pressed once,<br/>\
        and generates the release when pressed a second time.  Allows a user to 'hold' the shift key<br/>\
        without having the actually hold a key.
LDS_KEYBOARD_CONTROL  = One button which generates a control-key press event when pressed once,<br/>\
        and generates the release when pressed a second time.  Allows a user to 'hold' the control key<br/>\
        without having the actually hold a key.
