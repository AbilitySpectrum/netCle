LDS_ONE_BTN_MOUSE   = <html>Control a mouse with a single button.<br/>\
    A quick click generates a mouse left-click.<br/>\
    Press and hold the button, releasing after one beep and you will be in mouse-up mode.<br/>\
    Pressing the button in this mode will move the cursor up. Quick taps can be used to nudge the cursor to the desired location.<br/>\
    Release after two beeps and you will be in mouse-down mode.<br/>\
    Three beeps gets you to mouse-left mode and four gives you mouse-right.<br/>\
    Stop touching the button for 2 seconds and a low beep will announce that the system has reset and you may choose a new mouse direction.</html>
LDS_TWO_BTN_MOUSE   = <html>Control cursor motion with two toggle buttons.<br/>\
    One button controls up & down cursor motion the other controls left & right.<br/>\
    Press a button to move the cursor in one direction. Release the button until you hear a beep and then <br/>\
    press the button again to move the cursor in the opposite direction.<br/>\
    When used with the One Button Mouse Clicks solution this provides a fairly<br/>\
    complete mouse emulation.</html>
LDS_JOYSTICK_MOUSE1 = <html>A simple control which uses a joystick to move the mouse up, down left and right.<<br/>\
    You can optionally add the ability to generate a left or right mouse click by giving the joystick a quick left or right tap.</html>
LDS_JOYSTICK_MOUSE2 = <html>Allows a joystick to control mouse motion.<br/>\
    In addition a button is configured to toggle the up / down mouse motion with up and down scrolling.<br/>\
    The light box will indicate whether you are in mouse-moving or scrolling mode.<br/>\
    You can also add the ability to generate a left or right mouse click by giving the joystick a quick left or right tap.</html>
