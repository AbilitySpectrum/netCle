#
KP_DESCRIPTION = <html>Sometimes it can be difficult to press two keys at the same time.<br/>\
    This makes it impossible to type things like control+C.<br/>\
    This solution allows you to create a button that will send a modifier key (like shift or control) and a regular key \
    with a single press.</html>

# Joystick 1 Strings
#
JS1_DESCRIPTION = <html>A simple control which uses a joystick to move the mouse up, down left and right.<<br/>\
    You can optionally add the ability to generate a left or right mouse click by giving the joystick a quick left or right tap.</html>
JS1_LEFT_RIGHT_OPTION = Add left & right mouse click option.
JS1_AUDIO_FEEDBACK = Add audio feedback for mouse clicks.

# Joystick 2 Strings
#
JS2_DESCRIPTION = <html>Allows a joystick to control mouse motion.<br/>\
    In addition a button is configured to toggle the up / down mouse motion with up and down scrolling.<br/>\
    The light box will indicate whether you are in mouse-moving or scrolling mode.<br/>\
    You can also add the ability to generate a left or right mouse click by giving the joystick a quick left or right tap.</html>
JS1_LEFT_RIGHT_OPTION = Add left & right mouse click option.
JS2_LR_AUDIO = Add audio feedback for left & right click.
JS2_TOGGLE_AUDIO = Add audio feedback for the toggle button.

# One Button Simple Strings

OBS_DESCRIPTION = <html>A button which does a simple single function.</html>
OBS_FUNCTION = The button's function is:
OBS_AUDIO = Enable audio feedback when the button is pressed.

# One Button Toggle Strings
#
OBT_DESCRIPTION = <html>A single button with two complimentary functions.<br/> \
    Press the button and one function (e.g. mouse left) happens.<br/>\
    Release the button and a short beep will let you know the function has changed.<br/>\
    The next time you press the button you will get the opposite function (e.g. mouse right).<br/>\
    There is a short delay before the function switches.  This allows you to finely adjust the position with a series of short taps.</html>
OBT_FUNCTION = The button's function is:

#
# One Button Mouse Click Strings
OBMC_DESCRIPTION = <html>A single button provides the most useful mouse-click functions.<br/>\
    The button generates a left click when tapped.<br/>\Press and hold until you hear a beep to get a right click.<br/>\
    Press and hold until you hear a second beep to generate a left-button press action.<br/>\
    When used with the Two Button Cursor Control solution this provides a fairly<br/>\
    complete mouse emulation.</html>

#
# One Button Mouse Strings
OBM_DESCRIPTION = <html>Control a mouse with a single button.<br/>\
    A quick click generates a mouse left-click.<br/>\
    Press and hold the button, releasing after one beep and you will be in mouse-up mode.<br/>\
    Pressing the button in this mode will move the cursor up. Quick taps can be used to nudge the cursor to the desired location.<br/>\
    Release after two beeps and you will be in mouse-down mode.<br/>\
    Three beeps gets you to mouse-left mode and four gives you mouse-right.<br/>\
    Stop touching the button for 2 seconds and a low beep will announce that the system has reset and you may choose a new mouse direction.</html>
OBM_DELAY = The length of the delay between beeps (in milliseconds):
OBM_DELAY_ERROR_TAG = Delay
OBM_BEEP_DURATION = The duration of each beep (in milliseconds):
OBM_BEEP_ERROR_TAG = Duration

#
# Two Buttons Simple
TBS_DESCRIPTION = <html>Two buttons with simple complimentary functions.<br/>\
    The <b>left/right</b> click option creates buttons which generate left & right clicks when touched.<br/>\
    The <b>press/release</b> functions put the mouse into a pressed state when the <i>press</i> button is touched and release the mouse when the <i>release</i> button is touched.<br/>\
    The <b>left-button / right-button</b> option makes the buttons fully emulate the mouse buttons.<br/>\
    They are pressed when pressed and held, and released when released.
TBS_FUNCTION = How shall the buttons function?
TBS_AUDIO_FEEDBACK = Add audio feedback when the buttons are pressed.

#
# Two Button Cursor Control
TBCC_DESCRIPTION = <html>Control cursor motion with two toggle buttons.<br/>\
    One button controls up & down cursor motion the other controls left & right.<br/>\
    Press a button to move the cursor in one direction. Release the button until you hear a beep and then <br/>\
    press the button again to move the cursor in the opposite direction.<br/>\
    When used with the One Button Mouse Clicks solution this provides a fairly<br/>\
    complete mouse emulation.</html>
